        why: "HTML is the language browsers use to display content. Learning it lets you create meaningful, accessible web pages.",
        simpleExplanation: "HTML uses tags like <html>, <head>, and <body> to organize content; tags wrap content to give it meaning.",
        analogy: "Think of HTML as the frame of a house — it gives the rooms and walls where furniture (content) will go.",
        visual: "A simple page structure: \n<!doctype html>\n<html>\n  <head>...</head>\n  <body>...</body>\n</html>",
        explanation: "HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. Elements are written with angled brackets like <tag>content</tag>. Attributes add extra information to elements, e.g., <img src=\"image.jpg\" alt=\"...\">.",
        examples: "Example: <h1>Welcome</h1> creates a top-level heading. <p>This is a paragraph.</p> creates body text.",
        interactive: "Try creating a small HTML file with a heading, a paragraph, and an image. Use the live preview to see changes instantly.",
        commonMistakes: ["Forgetting to close tags", "Using <div> for everything instead of semantic elements", "Missing alt on images"],
        memoryAid: "Remember: Tags wrap content — start tag, content, end tag. Headings use h1..h6.",

        introduction: "Learn the precise syntax rules that make HTML valid and reliable across browsers.",
        why: "Correct syntax ensures browsers render your content consistently and helps screen readers and search engines.",
        simpleExplanation: "Elements use a start tag (<tag>), content, and an end tag (</tag>); some elements are self-closing like <img>.",
        analogy: "Think of tags as containers — some hold content, others are single objects like images.",
        visual: "<div>\n  <p>Paragraph inside a div</p>\n</div>",
        explanation: "Nesting must be correct: open a tag, add content, and close in reverse order. Attributes are key-value pairs inside the start tag.",
        examples: "<a href=\"https://example.com\">Link</a> sets an href attribute. <img src=\"x.jpg\" alt=\"...\"> shows an image.",

        simpleExplanation: "Use <h1> for the main title, then <h2>..<h6> for subheadings. Use <p> for paragraphs of text.",

        why: "Almost every navigation menu, article, and footer relies on lists and links, so getting them right affects usability everywhere.",
        simpleExplanation: "Use <ul> for unordered lists, <ol> for numbered lists, <li> for each item, and <a href=\"...\"> for links.",

        why: "The exact same subject can look flat and dull or dramatic and compelling purely based on the lighting.",
        simpleExplanation: "Soft, diffused light (like an overcast sky) is flattering and even; hard, direct light creates strong shadows and contrast.",

        visual: "Golden hour (soft, warm, low-angle) vs. harsh midday sun (hard shadows, high contrast)",
        explanation: "Golden hour — the hour after sunrise and before sunset — gives soft, warm, flattering light and is a favorite for portraits. Backlighting (light behind the subject) creates silhouettes or a glowing rim-light effect, and can add real drama.",
        examples: "Shooting a portrait during golden hour with the sun slightly behind the subject creates a warm rim of light around their hair and shoulders.",

        why: "Even great shots usually benefit from small adjustments; editing is a normal, expected part of the photography process, not 'cheating'.",
        simpleExplanation: "Adjust exposure (brightness), contrast, and crop first — those changes have the biggest visual impact.",

        explanation: "Free, capable editing tools: Snapseed (mobile, free) and Lightroom's free mobile app both offer real exposure, crop, and color controls. Make small, deliberate adjustments — over-editing (oversaturated colors, extreme contrast) usually looks worse than a light touch.",

        visual: "Wide establishing shot -> medium detail shots -> one strong closing image",
        explanation: "A classic structure: start with a wide 'establishing' shot that sets the scene, follow with detail/medium shots that build interest, and end with a strong closing image. Editing out photos that don't serve the theme is just as important as the shots you keep.",
        examples: "A 'morning routine' series: wide shot of the kitchen, a detail shot of coffee being poured, a shot of hands writing in a journal, ending on a shot walking out the door.",

        introduction: "Understanding aperture, shutter speed, and ISO — the exposure triangle — lets you shoot intentionally instead of relying on full auto.",
        why: "Manual control lets you decide exactly what's sharp, how much light comes in, and whether motion is frozen or blurred.",
        simpleExplanation: "Aperture controls background blur, shutter speed controls motion blur, and ISO controls brightness in low light.",
        analogy: "Aperture is like a pupil widening in the dark, shutter speed is how long the shutter 'blinks', and ISO is like turning up a room's light sensitivity.",
        visual: "Aperture f/1.8 (blurry background) vs f/11 (everything sharp)\nShutter 1/1000s (frozen motion) vs 1/10s (motion blur)",
        explanation: "A low f-number (like f/1.8) gives a shallow depth of field — great for portraits with a blurry background. Fast shutter speeds (1/500s+) freeze motion; slow ones (1/30s or slower) create intentional blur. Higher ISO brightens low-light shots but adds visible grain, so it's a tradeoff.",
        examples: "Shooting a portrait at f/2.0 blurs the background nicely; shooting a sports action shot needs a fast shutter like 1/1000s to freeze motion.",
